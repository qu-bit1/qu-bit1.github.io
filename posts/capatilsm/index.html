<p>so a bit of life updates first if you&rsquo;re wondering. lately i escaped the treacherous city of gurgaon somehow alive after being a contractual 2 month employee of a company, who realised that i am evil enough to help them catch more clients and flip up their competetor&rsquo;s pokemons whenever i see them, that they offered me a return offer(hope they dont read this)(maybe i&rsquo;ll remove this part and wont go in detail dm for my adventures). didnt had many friends there(like i have a ton here ready to hang out anytime) the ones i had either preferred to stay in their room or go back to their womb place(ik they aint reading this too).  so i had to pass time on my own and how fun is it binge watch 8 seasons of dexter isnt it. i explored almost every big movie theatre there, watched a movie alone in a single hall, experienced imax, rode the 4dx seats, even watched some &ldquo;comedies&rdquo;, watched almost every single film released during those two months. went to many overpriced cafes, ordered many overpriced drinks and food realising i can make them on my own too so i did, ranging from mexican bowls to blueberry smoothie bowls to &ldquo;some-random-shitass-name&rdquo;-latte, mastered the art of playing foosball, bargaining, paying rents and whatnot hell i even joined gym to kill boredom.</p>
<p>hall 1 aint much fun as told, campus seems boring now too as i am in a superposition of my peak social anxiety &amp; idc much attitude. with people distributed, different schedules and them with other friends i dont got much to do, most of my day i work on my paper, study(yes) and just existing. classes ain&rsquo;t fun too dont know most of them to sit together with. also isnt it fun when you try everything to indulge with friends but turns out you&rsquo;re at the bottom of the list.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-right-to-privacy">privacy and right to privacy<a href="#privacy-and-right-to-privacy" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>pairing all the above traits with social media what do we get? we get consumers. i had time to reflect on my spendings and who i worship. by some super analysis i realised that i am a consumer next thing i did watched fight club. i then went on to my 2021 mode, when i first about <img src="https://tuta.com/" alt="tutanota"> and had a <img src="https://skiff.com/mail" alt="skiff"> email address(rip skiff). i started researching more on security part and how analytics shaped my life. i have bought many unnecessary things in the past due to my over indulgence on social media, i dont wanna go into much details as this is not a tech blog post yet. so i tried and tested out the concepts of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>emails</li>
<li>vpns</li>
<li>dns</li>
<li>rooted phone functionalities(never bricked my phone)</li>
<li>decentralisation and aliases</li>
<li>search engines(hell i even tried kagi)</li>
<li>browsers</li>
<li>ordered an aeropress</li>
</ol>
<p>TODO: complete if mood</p>
<p>tho this won&rsquo;t be a film blog(will write one in the near future)</p>
