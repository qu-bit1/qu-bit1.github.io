      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;dead-or-alive&#34;&gt;dead or alive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so a bit of life updates first if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering. lately i escaped the treacherous city of gurgaon somehow alive after being a contractual 2 month employee of a company, who realised that i am evil enough to help them catch more clients and flip up their competetor&amp;rsquo;s pokemons whenever i see them, that they offered me a return offer(hope they dont read this)(maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll remove this part and wont go in detail dm for my adventures). didnt had many friends there(like i have a ton here ready to hang out anytime) the ones i had either preferred to stay in their room or go back to their womb place(ik they aint reading this too).  so i had to pass time on my own and how fun is it binge watch 8 seasons of dexter isnt it. i explored almost every big movie theatre there, watched a movie alone in a single hall, experienced imax, rode the 4dx seats, even watched some &amp;ldquo;comedies&amp;rdquo;, watched almost every single film released during those two months. went to many overpriced cafes, ordered many overpriced drinks and food realising i can make them on my own too so i did, ranging from mexican bowls to blueberry smoothie bowls to &amp;ldquo;some-random-shitass-name&amp;rdquo;-latte, mastered the art of playing foosball, bargaining, paying rents and whatnot hell i even joined gym to kill boredom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;hall 1 aint much fun as told, campus seems boring now too as i am in a superposition of my peak social anxiety &amp;amp; idc much attitude. with people distributed, different schedules and them with other friends i dont got much to do, most of my day i work on my paper, study(yes) and just existing. classes ain&amp;rsquo;t fun too dont know most of them to sit together with. also isnt it fun when you try everything to indulge with friends but turns out you&amp;rsquo;re at the bottom of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-and-right-to-privacy&#34;&gt;privacy and right to privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pairing all the above traits with social media what do we get? we get consumers. i had time to reflect on my spendings and who i worship. by some super analysis i realised that i am a consumer next thing i did watched fight club. i then went on to my 2021 mode, when i first about &lt;img src=&#34;https://tuta.com/&#34; alt=&#34;tutanota&#34;&gt; and had a &lt;img src=&#34;https://skiff.com/mail&#34; alt=&#34;skiff&#34;&gt; email address(rip skiff). i started researching more on security part and how analytics shaped my life. i have bought many unnecessary things in the past due to my over indulgence on social media, i dont wanna go into much details as this is not a tech blog post yet. so i tried and tested out the concepts of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vpns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rooted phone functionalities(never bricked my phone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decentralisation and aliases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search engines(hell i even tried kagi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ordered an aeropress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: complete if mood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tho this won&amp;rsquo;t be a film blog(will write one in the near future)&lt;/p&gt;
